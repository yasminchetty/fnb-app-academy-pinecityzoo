                           <h3>KOALAS</h3>
                           <p>The koalas (phascolarctos cinereus,or,in accurately,koala bear[a])is an arboreal herbivorous
marsupial native to australia.it is the only extent representative of the family phascolarctidae and its closest
living relatives are the wombats.the koala is found in coastal areas of the mainlands eastern and southern regions
,inhabiting queensland,new south wales,victoria,and south australia.it is easily recognisable by its stout,tailless
body and large head with round,fluffy ears and large,spoon-shaped nose.the koala has a body lenght of 60 to 85cm
(24 to 33in)and weighs 4 to 15kg(9 to 33lb).pelage color ranges from silver grey to choclate brown.koalas form
the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in color than their counter parts further south.
these populations possibly are seperate subspecies,but this is disputed.</p>
                         <p>Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands,and the leaves of these trees make up most of thier diet.
because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content,koalas are largely sedentry and sleep up to 20 hours a day.
they are asocial animals,and bonding exists only mothers and dependant offspring.adult males communicate with loud bellows that 
intimadate rivals and attracts mates.males mark thier presence with secretions from scent glands located on thier chest.
being marsupials,koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers pouches,where they stay
for the first 6 to 7 months of thier lives.these young koalas known as joeys,are fully weaned around a year old.
koalas have few natural predators and parasites,but are threatened by various pathogens such as chlamydiaceae bacteria
and the koala retrovirus,as well as by bushfires and draught. </p>
