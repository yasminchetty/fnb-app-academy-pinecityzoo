                           <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
                           <p>The giraffe (giraffa camelopardalis)is an african even-toed ungulate mammal,the 
tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant.its species name refers to its camel-like shape and
its leopard-like colouring.its chief distinguising characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs,
its horn-like ossicones,and its distinctive coat patterns.it is classified under the family giraffidae,along
with its closest extant relative,the okapi.the nine subspecies are distinguised by thier coat patterns.</p>
                           <p>The giraffe's scattered range extends from chad in the north to south africa
in the south,and from niger in the west to somalia in the east.giraffes usually inhabit savannahs,grasslands
and open woodlands.thier primary food source is acacia leaves,which they browse at heights most other herbivores
cannot reach.</p>
                            <p>Giraffes are preyed on by lions;thier calves are also targeted by leopards,spotted
hyenas,and african wild dogs.adult giraffes do not have strong social bonds,though they do gather in loose aggregations
if they happen to be moving in the same general direction.males establish social hierarchies through "necking",which
are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon.dominant males gain mating access to females,which bear
the sole responsiblity for raising the young.</p>
