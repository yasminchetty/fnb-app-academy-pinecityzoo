                           <h3>LIONS</h3>
                           <p>The lion (panthera leo) is one of the five big cats in the genus panthera and a member of the family felidae.
the commonly used term african lion collectively denotes the several subspecies found in africa.with some males exceeding
250kg(550 lb)in weight,it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger.</p>
                           <p>Wild lions currently exist in sub-saharan africa and in asia(where an endangered remnant populations resides in gir
                            forest national park in india)while other types of lions have disappeared from north africa and south west asia 
in historic times.until the late pleistocene,about 10,000 years ago,the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans.
they were found in most of africa across eurasia from western europe to india,and in the americas from the Yukon to Paru.
the lion is a vulnerable species,having seen a major population decline in its african range of 30 to 50% per two decades
during the second half of the twenth century.lion populations are untendable outside designated reserves and ntional parks.
although the cause of the decline is not fully understood,habitat loss and conflicts with humans are currently the greatest
causes of concern.within africa,the west african lion population is particulary endangered.
