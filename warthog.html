                           <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
                           <p>Phacochoerinae is a genus of wild pigs in the family suidae,known as warthogs.it is the sole genus of subfamily
phacochoerinae.they are found in open and semi open habitats,even in quiet arid regions,in sub-saharan africa.the two species
were formerly considered conspecific under the scientific name Phacochoerus aethiopicus,but today this is limited
to the desert warthog,while the best-known and most widespread species,the common warthog(or simply warthog)
is phacochoerus africanus.
                            <p>although covered in bristly hairs,their bodies and heads appear largely naked from a distance
with only the crest along the back,and the tufts on thier cheeks and tails being obviously haired.the english name refers
to their facial wattles,which are particularly distinct in males.they also have very distinct tusks,which reach a lenght of
25,5 to 63,5 cm (10.0 to 25.0 in)in the males,but are always smaller in the females.they are largely herbivorous,
but occasionally also eat small animal food.while both species remain fairly common and widespread,and therefore
are considered to be of least concerned by the IUCN,the nominate subspecies of the desert warthog,commanly
known as the cape warthog,became extinct around 1865.</p>

                            <p>You will find the warthogs at WA11, near the elephant enclosure</p>
